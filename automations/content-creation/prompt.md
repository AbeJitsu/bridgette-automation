# Daily Content Creation

Research trending AI topics from the last 24 hours. Create three LinkedIn post options, each with a different angle:

1. **Educational** — Explain the topic in a way that helps professionals understand the impact
2. **Opinion** — Take a stance on what this means for the industry
3. **Practical** — Share actionable takeaways or how-to insights

For each post:
- Write 150-250 words
- Include a hook in the first line
- End with a question or call to action
- Suggest 3-5 relevant hashtags

After writing the posts, use Claude in Chrome to open Gemini (already logged in) and generate an image for each post. Save images alongside the post text.

Output everything to a dated folder: `automations/content-creation/results/YYYY-MM-DD/`
