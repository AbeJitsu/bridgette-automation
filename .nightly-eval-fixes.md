# Nightly Eval Fixes Log

Detailed record of all fixes implemented during nightly eval cycles. Each fix is committed separately with a descriptive message.

## Format

Each entry shows:
- **Eval** — Which type (frontend/backend/functionality/memory)
- **Date** — When it ran
- **Issue** — What was broken/missing
- **Fix** — How it was fixed
- **Commit** — Reference to the git commit

## Fixes

### [Pending first nightly eval run]

No fixes yet. Waiting for first scheduled eval cycle.

## How Evals Use This Log

At the start of each eval, **read the recent fixes in this log** to:

1. **Avoid duplication** — Don't fix issues already listed here
2. **Understand context** — See what's been improved and what still needs work
3. **Track progress** — Monitor improvements across the codebase
4. **Plan strategically** — Focus on remaining high-impact issues

## Format for New Entries

When adding fixes from a completed eval, use this format:

```
### Eval: [frontend/backend/functionality/memory] — [Date] — Status: [success/partial]

**Fix 1 — [issue name]**
- Issue: [describe what was broken]
- Fix: [describe the solution]
- Commit: [hash or message]

**Fix 2 — [next issue name]**
- Issue: ...
- Fix: ...
- Commit: ...

[... repeat for each fix ...]
```

## Querying Fixes

To see what was fixed in recent evals:

```bash
# See all fixes from past week
grep -E "^###" .nightly-eval-fixes.md | tail -5

# Check what frontend issues were fixed
grep -A 20 "Eval: frontend" .nightly-eval-fixes.md
```

*This log is maintained automatically by nightly eval processes. Manual updates should preserve chronological order (most recent at the top of the fixes section).*
