# Memory — Directory Notes

## What This Is

Shared memory system for the Claude Code dashboard. These markdown files are the persistent memory layer — read by Claude sessions, editable through the dashboard UI.

## Philosophy

Curated over automated. Actively edit as understanding evolves. Remove dead ends. The doc is the memory, not a transcript.

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | Edit Frequency |
|------|---------|----------------|
| SOUL.md | Personality and tone | Rarely — once established |
| IDENTITY.md | Who the assistant is | Rarely |
| USER.md | Context about Abe | Occasionally — as preferences change |
| AGENTS.md | Behavior rules for sessions | Occasionally |
| HEARTBEAT.md | Monitoring checklist | As monitoring needs evolve |
| MEMORY.md | Curated persistent facts | Frequently — living document |
| TOOLS.md | Local environment notes | When setup changes |

## Merging Notes

Originally lived at `~/claude-memory/`. Merged into this repo January 2026. The original repo had git history — preserved there if needed.
